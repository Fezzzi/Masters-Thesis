# API
API is thoroughly described via [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/) specification. There should be
plugins available for a majority of IDEs that allow a dynamic preview of specification [file](./ApiSpecs.json).

**Each change in the API of the application is to be properly documented within the
specification file!**
